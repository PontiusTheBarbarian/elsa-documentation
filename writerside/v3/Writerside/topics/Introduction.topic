    <p>
        Elsa Workflows is a powerful and flexible <b>execution</b> engine, encapsulated as a set of open-source .NET libraries
        designed to infuse .NET applications with workflow capabilities. With Elsa, developers can weave <b>logic</b> directly
        into their <b>systems</b>, enhancing functionality and <b>automation</b> and align seamlessly with the applicationâ€™s core
        functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workflows in Elsa can be defined in two ways:
    </p>
    <list>

        <li>
            Programmatically: By writing .NET code, developers can define complex workflows tailored to specific
            business needs.
        </li>
        <li>Visually: Using the built-in designer, non-developers or those who prefer a visual approach can create and
            modify workflows with ease.
        </li>
    </list>

    <p>Elsa's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple task automation to complex
        business process management. Its modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing systems, making
        it a top choice for developers looking to add workflow functionality to their projects.</p>
