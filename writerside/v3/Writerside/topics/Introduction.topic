    <p>
        Elsa Workflows is a powerful and flexible <b>execution</b> engine, encapsulated as a set of open-source .NET libraries
        designed to infuse .NET applications with workflow capabilities. With Elsa, developers can weave <b>logic</b> directly
        into their <b>systems</b>, enhancing functionality and <b>automation</b> and align seamlessly with the applicationâ€™s core
        functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workflows in Elsa can be defined in two ways:
    </p>
    <list>
        <li>
            Programmatically: By writing .NET code, developers can define complex workflows tailored to specific
            business needs.
        </li>
        <li>Visually: Using the built-in designer, non-developers or those who prefer a visual approach can create and
            modify workflows with ease.
        </li>
    </list>
